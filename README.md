## Overview
This report analyzes a conceptual remote data and real-time application solution used to monitor healthcare patients using IoT wearable device sensor management, real time data dashboards and alerts. 

## REST and GraphQL for Data Requests and Updates
*Explain how both REST and GraphQL could be used to handle the data requests and updates required by the system.*

## WebSockets for Real-time Communication
*Describe how WebSockets could be used to handle real-time communication in your chosen system.*

## Technology Recommendation and Justification
*Recommend which technology (or combination of technologies) you would choose for your system and justify your recommendation based on your analysis in Sections 1 and 2.*

## System Architecture Diagram
*Create a diagram that illustrates the overall architecture of your system, showing how clients, APIs (REST and/or GraphQL), WebSockets, and backend services connect and interact. You may use any diagramming tool (e.g., draw.io, Lucidchart, Excalidraw, Mermaid) and include the diagram as an image in your report.*
